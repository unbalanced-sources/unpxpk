# unpxpk
Utility to unpack old (like 1990 old) EA games resource files, contained in the EA games LIB files. 

So possibly you will need to use LIB unpacker (https://github.com/unbalanced-sources/ealibextr) first.

Usage examples: "unpxpk -h picture -f lhx\CP_OSP4.PIC" in case of the picture unpack or "unpxpk -f lhx\4X6.FNT" in other cases. Further details are available upon running the utility without any parameters.
